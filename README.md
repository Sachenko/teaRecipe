# teaRecipe
Hello User. 
This project is the first project that was made or realize Stanley Sachenko.
Im try do this code maximum understand for All. I do not pretend that this code is perfect. 
But as an engineer, I try to adhere to generally accepted rules of design and code creation.

Usually, in recipes, photos are added immediately after the text description of the action.
But not here =) 
Here there will be Java code.
Add a drop of imagination and you will be able to create delicious tea.
